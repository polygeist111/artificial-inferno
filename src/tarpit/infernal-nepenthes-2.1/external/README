The following files here are dependencies not part of the Nepenthes
distribution, included in the release tarball as a way to simplify
installation. They have their own authors and licenses; deploying
Nepenthes requires you to accept them as well:

	
lustache			MIT
dkjson				MIT/X11
basexx				MIT
binaryheap			MIT/X11
fifo				MIT/X11
lpeg_patterns		MIT/X11
http				MIT
api7-lua-tinyyaml	MIT


The following were pulled from Luarocks as well, but written by myself,
and are under the same license terms as Nepenthes (MIT):
